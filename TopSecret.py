''' If you're pushing your script onto GitHub 
    you're not gonna want to put your password
    out there on the open internet. So by 
    extracting your password from here is a 
    great idea! you can ignore this file 
    (.gitignore) in your push to leave it out. 
    This will protect your valuable data.
